# An infinite loop that prints “Infinite”. An infinite loop never ends. The condition is always true.

#for x in "Infinite":
    #print("Infinite")

#x = 0
#while x < 5:
    #x += 1
    #print(x)
##This while loop will run 5 times, as eventually x + 1 will equal to 5 and the condition will be False

x = True
while x == True:
    print("Infinite")
